- 👋 Hi, I’m Lewis Nguyen (@lewistnguyen) [he/him/his].
- 🎓 I'm an undergraduate student currently in my third year of study at Denison University (Granville, Ohio, United States), double-majoring in Chemistry and Mathematics, 
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in investigating the intersection of physics, chemistry and mathematics to answer unsolved questions of the natural world. I am also interested in how we could harness these tools to understand many facets of the human society, including democracy, modern languages, social interaction, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning statistical and quantum mechanics. I'm also learning Italian and Hungarian languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational chemistry and applied mathematics.
- 📫 Reach out to me at nguyen_h10 at denison.edu!
